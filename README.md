# Supersig Pallet

The supersig pallet extends the capabilities of a multisig so it can be fit for governance of
larger funds. It is a superset of the multisig pallet, adding multiple functionalities and
options to the original multi-signature dispatch allowing multiple signed origins (accounts) to
coordinate and dispatch a call from the supersig account

Note: the multisig addresses wonâ€™t change even though the members can be added, removed, or can
leave themselves

## Overview

The Supersig pallet provide function for:

- Creating a supersig
- Adding and removing members
- Leaving the supersig
- Submit transaction to a supersig
- Vote for the transaction
- Remove a pending transaction
- Delete a supersig


### Dispatchable Functions

- `create_supersig` - create a supersig, with specified members. The creator will have to
  deposit an existencial balance and a deposit that depend on the number of members, in the
  supersig account. This last amount will be reserved on the supersig

  /!!\ note of caution /!!\ the creator of the supersig will NOT be added by default, he will
  have to pass his adress into the list of added users.

- `propose_call` - make a proposal on the specified supersig. an amount corresponding to the
  length of the encoded call will be reserved.

- `approve_call` - give a positive vote to a call. if the number of vote >= SimpleMajority, the
  call is executed. An user can only approve a call once.

- `remove_call` - remove a call from the poll. The reserved amount of the proposer will be
  unreserved

- `add_members` - add new members to the supersig. In case some user are already in the
  supersig, they will be ignored.

- `remove_members` - remove members from the supersig. In case some user are not in the
  supersig, they will be ignored.

- `remove_supersig` - remove the supersig and all the associated data. Funds will be unreserved
  and transfered to specified beneficiary.

- `leave_supersig` - remove the caller from the supersig.

## Test
