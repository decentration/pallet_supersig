# Supersig Pallet

The supersig pallet is a multisig with super powers.
It allows you to add and remove members of the multisig.
It extends the capabilities of a multisig so it can be fit for governance of larger funds.

A multisig transaction acts more like a funding proposal.
And the signatures become votes, with a quorum that can be changed

Good to know: the multisig addresses wonâ€™t change even though the members can be added or removed.
